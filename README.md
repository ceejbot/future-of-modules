A talk for Fluent 2018 in San Jose.

## Slides:

* [slide source in markdown format](./slides.md)
* [rendered slides as a PDF](./slides.pdf)
* [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/ceejbot/the-future-of-javascript-modules-in-node)

## Code examples

The [word-checker](./word-checker/) subdirectory has an extremely contrived example of the [esm](https://github.com/standard-things/esm) module in use. The example is small enough to understand in a few minutes.
